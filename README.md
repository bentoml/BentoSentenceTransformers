Sentence embedding technology transforms sentences into vectors in a high-dimensional space, capturing semantic meaning such that sentences with similar meanings are positioned closer together, enabling various natural language processing tasks like text classification, similarity comparison, and information retrieval.

This project demonstrates how to build a sentence embedding application using BentoML, powered by [SentenceTransformers](https://www.sbert.net).

## Prerequisites

- You have installed Python 3.8+ and¬†`pip`. See the¬†[Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/)¬†to learn more.
- You have a basic understanding of key concepts in BentoML, such as Services. We recommend you read [Quickstart](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/1.2/get-started/quickstart.html) first.
- (Optional) We recommend you create a virtual environment for dependency isolation for this project. See the [Conda documentation](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) or the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for details.

## Install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bentoml/BentoSentenceTransformers.git
cd BentoSentenceTransformers
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the BentoML Service

We have defined a BentoML Service in `service.py`. Run¬†`bentoml¬†serve`¬†in your project directory to start the Service.

```bash
$ bentoml serve .

2024-01-18T06:40:53+0800 [INFO] [cli] Prometheus metrics for HTTP BentoServer from "service:SentenceEmbedding" can be accessed at http://localhost:3000/metrics.
2024-01-18T06:40:54+0800 [INFO] [cli] Starting production HTTP BentoServer from "service:SentenceEmbedding" listening on http://localhost:3000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
Model loaded device: cpu
```

The server is now active at¬†[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/). You can interact with it using the Swagger UI or in other different ways.

CURL

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:3000/encode' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "sentences": [
    "hello world"
  ]
}'
```

Python client

```python
import bentoml

with bentoml.SyncHTTPClient("http://localhost:3000") as client:
    result = client.encode(
        sentences=[
                "hello world"
        ],
    )
```

## Deploy to BentoCloud

After the Service is ready, you can deploy the application to BentoCloud for better management and scalability. [Sign up](https://www.bentoml.com/) if you haven't got a BentoCloud account.

Make sure you have [logged in to BentoCloud](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/bentocloud/how-tos/manage-access-token.html), then run the following command to deploy it.

```bash
bentoml deploy .
```

Once the application is up and running on BentoCloud, you can access it via the exposed URL.

**Note**: For custom deployment in your own infrastructure, use [BentoML to generate an OCI-compliant image](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/guides/containerization.html).
